    <h1 id="title">The Time Is Gold But Not For Everyday Commuting: Can Hybrid Learning Reduce Commuting Days?</h1>

            <h1 id="intro">Before Commuting From QC to Manila</h1>
            <p> When i was a child, <strong>i thought that commuting was not a big deal</strong>, i think of it as just a roadtrip since i am currently living in Novaliches, Quezon City where i dont get affected by the traffic because my school is a walking distance, from elementary to senior highschool. I wasn't aware about the traffic problems in the Philippines because <strong>i rarely go into Manila and go roadtrips.</strong></p>

            <p>Then one day, when i was about to graduate from senior highschool, i decided that i will be studying in University of the East Manila Campus, thats because it is one of the great university that specialize in IT. Since i wasn't aware, my parents and my older sister told me that <q>Hindi biro ang bibiyahe ng malayo at araw-araw. Mahihirapan ka talaga diyan. Time is Gold at kailangan gumising ng maaga para hindi malate</q> But i thought to my self thinking it can't be that bad, all i have to do is to just think of it like a roadtrip. But when i became a college freshmen, that is when i realized, <strong>everyday commuting is not a fun roadtrip and its tiring.</strong></p>

            <h1>Thoughts About The Traffic Experience in Daily Commuting</h1>
            <p>Traffic is a common problem in the Philippines and is happening for a long time, where:</p>
            <p>As someone who commutes everyday from Novaliches all the way to Morayta. <strong>My personal experience was very bad.</strong> Because why do we always have to face heavy rush hour traffic almost everyday just to go to school or work sweaty and smells a hint of polluted air. The cause of this is:</p>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li><strong>Short paths becomes long paths.</strong> There are also bottlenecks on the parts of the road as these bottlenecks makes traffic worse.</li>
                <li><strong>Rush hours</strong> usually happen during early in the morning, night, weekdays like monday, friday, and holidays such as christmas.</li>
                <li>Traffic happens on Commonwealth, some parts of Quezon Avenue, Espana, Quirino Highway, Edsa, Rizal, and many more.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>It wastes people's time</strong> because of traffic which i said Time isnt Gold, because it doesnt treasure time, especially a commuter that has super early schedule like 7am.</p>

            <h1 id="end">My Preferred Solutions in Traffic</h1>
            <p>I personally think the <strong>prior solution</strong> is that the government should prioritize on:</p>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li><strong>Reducing the traffic, and railway systems.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Improve the stoplight system</strong>, this is to create great flows and reduces traffic.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve the design model for transport vehicles</strong> like jeepney, and bus. Completely remove private bus companies, and instead turn it into government bus with a systematic routes that is literally free for our own benefits as a taxpayers, as an example from London bus.</li>
                <li>Professionals and students schedules should not be very early and very late like we are some sort of robot, unlike some other countries that has great morning schedules.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For me, hybrid learning should be assessed properly, For example:</p>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Schools should have 2 to 3 days online on weekday.</li>
                <li>Colleges that doesnt have hands on activity should be like 2 weekdays online per week.</li>
                <li>And work environment like tech companies should have 1 day onsite per week or even full work from home.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Time should be efficient and valuable like Gold</strong>. Time is meant to be wasted as it keeps moving forward and <strong>there is no turning back</strong>, if we let heavy traffic happen to us over and over again, alot of time will be waste and we tire ourselves from it.</p>
