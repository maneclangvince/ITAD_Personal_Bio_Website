            <h1>Becoming a Fullstack Software Engineer</h1>
            <p>Although I did some projects like a <strong>Database Management System during my Senior High School years</strong>, I still need to improve to become a <strong>Fullstack Software Engineer</strong>. I want to be like <strong>Bryl Lim</strong> and <strong>Jed Tan</strong>. I am inspired by them because they are <strong>Fullstack Software Engineers known in the TikTok community</strong>. I still have <strong>a long path to go</strong> and I <strong>make mistakes from time to time</strong>. But <strong>giving up is not an option</strong> when you want to become a Fullstack Software Engineer. That is why I need to <strong>continuously learn</strong> and <strong>stay consistent</strong>, especially since <strong>technology keeps evolving, and I should evolve as well</strong>.</p>

            <h1>Becoming Jack Of All Trades</h1>
            <p>The reason why I want to be a <strong>Jack Of All Trades</strong> is because I just saw this guy from YouTube and I'm <strong>inspired by him</strong>, his name is <strong>Mike Shake</strong>. He makes content about <strong>learning new skills that interest him</strong>, and he wants to try if he can do it or not. He is also an <strong>optimistic guy who doesn't give up</strong> on what he is learning. I want to be like that as well, <strong>to learn something new</strong>, <strong>gain new perspectives</strong>, and <strong>utilize it for my own good</strong>.</p>

            <h1>Getting Rich in Young Adult Years</h1>
            <p>I want to be <strong>rich in my late 20's</strong> because I want to <strong>financially help my family</strong>, <strong>treat my parents well</strong> as they helped me through my childhood, teenage, and college years, and even when I got sick. I also want to <strong>care for myself</strong>, <strong>buy things I want</strong> like a <strong>motorcycle</strong>, have my <strong>own condo and work in BGC</strong>, <strong>buy the clothes I want</strong>, have a <strong>gym room</strong>, and <strong>buy a PC with great performance</strong>.</p>

            <h1>Travelling to my Dream Places</h1>
            <p>When I get <strong>rich in my late 20's</strong>, the thing I want the most is <strong>travelling all around the world with my parents</strong>. This is not just my goal, but also <strong>my parents' goal</strong>. The only one who has travelled the world is my father because he is a <strong>seaman</strong>. But it's <strong>our dream</strong> because we think that if we travel the world together, we are finally <strong>free from our struggles and challenges</strong>.</p>
