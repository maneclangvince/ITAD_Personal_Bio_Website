            <h1 id="childhood">Simple But Funny Childhood Experience</h1>
            <p>My childhood was <strong>simple and quiet</strong><sup>(1)</sup>. My mother and father lived with me in my grandmother’s house<sup>(2)</sup>. Life felt ordinary during those early years<sup>(3)</sup>. After some time, we moved into a new apartment<sup>(4)</sup>. At first, we felt <strong>relief and comfort</strong> in our new home<sup>(5)</sup>. However, we later realized that the apartment was <strong>haunted by crying ghosts</strong><sup>(6)</sup>. The strange experiences slowly became <strong>more disturbing</strong> as time passed<sup>(7)</sup>. Some nights were filled with <strong>fear and confusion</strong><sup>(8)</sup>. After two years, we decided to move again to escape the hauntings<sup>(9)</sup>. We believed the next apartment would finally be safe<sup>(10)</sup>. Unfortunately, <strong>something more sinister appeared</strong><sup>(11)</sup>. It felt like a <strong>devil-like creature</strong> was present in the house<sup>(12)</sup>. One day, we took a family picture together<sup>(13)</sup>. The creature appeared in the photo as a <strong>dark shadow</strong><sup>(14)</sup>. The image looked corrupted, as if the phone itself was affected<sup>(15)</sup>. We were <strong>terrified</strong> and could not stay any longer in that place<sup>(16)</sup>. After one year, we moved into our current house<sup>(17)</sup>. This time, the strange experiences finally <strong>stopped completely</strong><sup>(18)</sup>. I also remember playing outside with my childhood friends<sup>(19)</sup>. We played games like patingtero and other traditional childhood games<sup>(20)</sup>. Everything changed when the <strong>internet was introduced into my life</strong><sup>(21)</sup>. Online gaming became my <strong>main hobby and part of my lifestyle</strong><sup>(22)</sup>.

            <h1 id="teenager">My Peak Teenage Years That I Wont Forget</h1>
            <p>My teenage years were shaped by my <strong>introverted personality</strong><sup>(1)</sup>. I found it very difficult to communicate with other people<sup>(2)</sup>. It became even harder when someone did not match my vibe<sup>(3)</sup>. Because of this, I often chose to <strong>stay quiet and keep to myself</strong><sup>(4)</sup>. Over time, I realized that I should at least try to communicate with others<sup>(5)</sup>. I learned that <strong>no man is an island</strong><sup>(6)</sup>. Another important aspect of my teenage life was my attitude toward studying<sup>(7)</sup>. During my high school years, I <strong>barely studied at all</strong><sup>(8)</sup>. I was the type of student who felt satisfied with a grade of 75<sup>(9)</sup>. Unlike others, I did not think that a score below 90 meant failure<sup>(10)</sup>. I often <strong>slept in class</strong> while teachers were discussing lessons<sup>(11)</sup>. I also ate during class and sometimes left the room during recess<sup>(12)</sup>. I did not fully cut classes because I was studying in a Catholic school at that time<sup>(13)</sup>. Most of the time, I only did what was necessary to pass my subjects<sup>(14)</sup>. Everything began to change when I entered <strong>senior high school</strong><sup>(15)</sup>. For the first time, I became <strong>serious and disciplined</strong> in my studies<sup>(16)</sup>. I started putting in <strong>consistent effort and focus</strong><sup>(17)</sup>. From Grade 11 to Grade 12, I became a <strong>consistent honor student</strong><sup>(18)</sup>. My teachers noticed my improvement and felt proud of my progress<sup>(19)</sup>. Their recognition <strong>motivated me to work even harder</strong><sup>(20)</sup>. Honestly, this <strong>transformation and achievement</strong> felt incredibly great and fulfilling<sup>(21)</sup>.

            <p>My experience in college was <strong>pretty rough at the start</strong><sup>(1)</sup>. Everything felt <strong>overwhelming from the very first semester</strong><sup>(2)</sup>. I came from being a consistent honor student in senior high school<sup>(3)</sup>. Suddenly, I was barely getting a 1.75 in my final period grades for my subjects<sup>(4)</sup>. This <strong>drastic change affected my confidence</strong> a lot<sup>(5)</sup>. One major reason was the <strong>new school system that I had to adjust to</strong><sup>(6)</sup>. The expectations and rules were very different from what I was used to<sup>(7)</sup>. Every semester, I needed to adapt to new professors<sup>(8)</sup>. Each professor had a different teaching style and grading system<sup>(9)</sup>. It was also difficult to adjust to unfamiliar classmates and their behaviors<sup>(10)</sup>. Because of this, I usually struggled at the beginning of every semester<sup>(11)</sup>. However, I slowly improved as time went on<sup>(12)</sup>. I learned that <strong>adjustment was a constant part of college life</strong><sup>(13)</sup>. I chose UE because it is well known for IT and Computer Science<sup>(14)</sup>. The university is recognized as a Center of Excellence in these fields<sup>(15)</sup>. Compared to IT programs in other universities, the course was much harder<sup>(16)</sup>. Despite the difficulty, the experience <strong>taught me valuable lessons</strong><sup>(17)</sup>. One important lesson was to <strong>start projects early</strong><sup>(18)</sup>. This became crucial because of upcoming capstone projects<sup>(19)</sup>. The program <strong>prepared me for better job opportunities</strong> in the future<sup>(20)</sup>. It also helped shape a <strong>more disciplined IT lifestyle</strong><sup>(21)</sup>. I am <strong>truly thankful to my parents</strong> for giving me this opportunity and support<sup>(22)</sup>.
